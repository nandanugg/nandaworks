# Nandaworks backend system

This is my backend system that I build using Golang

## Q&A
### No docker?
Yes, because it's not really needed, I publish this app to my own server which already have all that are needed to run this, unless in the future there are new cool technology that I want to try but still unstable to install in my server, I might do change

### Why travis?
It's free, thus I already installed travis in my server, so I don't want resources to be wasted

### Why Svelte for the frontend?
I found it easier for my simple webpage

### No SSR?
I found it quite hard to integrate SSR from Svelte, but the Svelte build size doesn't big either, so for now, it doesn't matter

### No frontend testing? What a shame...
I still learning, somehow I found that testing the frontend is still not worth the effort, I still thinks that frontend need automated test, but only for a big apps

### Your code is wierd~
I learn backend from NodeJS ðŸ™ƒ that's why the OOP segment is kinda screwed, I feel like I still need to wrap my head sometimes to Go
